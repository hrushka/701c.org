## An enthusiasts guide to restoring and preserving an iconic portable.

I’ve made all the walkthroughs, guides, code, and assets I’ve created available free of charge. They are the results of countless hours of research, experimenting, and learning. I do all of this willingly at my own expense and because I have a passion for creating and preserving.
